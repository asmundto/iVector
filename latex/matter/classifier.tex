\chapter{Discriminative Classification}
\label{sect:classify}

In this section we will look at discriminative classifiers that can be used to differentiate utterances defined in the vector space discussed in section ???. Discriminative classifiers differ from the generative gaussian mixture model approach given in section ?? in that it cannot be used to generate syntethic data. This often results in a simpler optimization problem which is easier to train to give good performance \cite[p. 204]{machinelearningbook}. Discriminative classifiers can be used on both the full sized document vector or one that is compressed using subspace modelling. We will first look at binary classifiers, where each utterance can take one of two classes in section ?? and ??, and then extend the technique to multiple classes in section ??. Finally we will explore techniques that can increase the effectiveness of the classifier in section ??.

\section{Support Vector Machines}
\label{sect:svm}

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been extensively used and represents the state-of-the-art classifier for text-classification problems \cite[319]{information}. During training, the binary SVM will find a hyperplane that seperates the two classes (known as $+1$ and $-1$ class). Any coordinates, $\mathbf{x}$, that lie on this plane will satisfy
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}+b=0
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{w}$ is the normal vector to the plane and $b$ a scalar. Classification is performed by checking what side of the hyperplane a document, $\mathbf{y}$, lies on by
\begin{equation}
\label{svmclassify}
\operatorname{sign}(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}+b)
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{sign}(a)$ returns $+1$ if $a$ is positive and $-1$ otherwise \ref[322]{information}. Since the plane can be defined using both $\mathbf{w}$ and $-\mathbf{w}$, we can choose a planar equation during training so that the output from equation \ref{svmclassify} can be directly interpreted as the most probable identity of document $y$ . A natural measure of our confidence in the labeling of document $y$ would be the geometric distance between a document and the decision boundary. If the distance is high, then the document is far inside the region where typical documents of the region's class lie. On the other hand, a small distance implies that minor changes in the document vector or the seperating hyperplane could result in a different classification. The euclidean distance between a document and the hyperplane will be the absolute value of \cite[p. 323]{information}
\begin{equation}
\label{svmeucdist}
\frac{\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}+b}{|\mathbf{w}|}.
\end{equation}
This equation is quite similar to equation \ref{svmclassify} except that it is invariant to the vector-length of $\mathbf{w}$.

During training of the SVM we need to find the hyperplane that separates the training data. For now we will assume that the data is lineary separable, so that there exists at least one such plane. If there exist more than one plane that separates the classes, we would prefer to use the separating plane that has the largest geometric distance from all document in the training set. Since planes can be defined by normal vectors of any length, we can let the length of $1/|\mathbf{w}|$ be the minimum geometric distance between the plane defined by $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, and any training vector. This can be stated as the constraint \cite[p. 324]{information}
\begin{equation}
\label{svmconstraint}
c_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b) \geq 1, \forall i
\end{equation}
where $c_i \in \{ -1, +1 \}$ is the true class of training document $y_i$. The hyperplane with the largest geometric margin between any training vector can then be found by minimizing $|\mathbf{w}|$ while upholding the constraints in equation \ref{svmconstraint}.

Since it generally cannot be expected that all classes can be linearly separated, there will be some data sets where the constraints in equation \ref{svmconstraint} cannot be fullfilled. Even if the constraints can be fullfilled, there might be some sets where a few unrepresentative document vectors force us to settle with a decision boundry with very little margin between the two classes, just so that we can correctly classify those vectors with any margin at all. Since a single document can have a drastic effect on the decision boundary, the constraints in equation \ref{svmconstraint} will make the classifier have a high model variance. In order to give the learning method less variance, it might be better to have a more biased model that isn't able to correctly classify all documents in the training set. Because of this, SVM often solves an unconstrained problem, where some documents may disregard the constraints in equation \ref{svmconstraint}. One such problem is that of a l2 regularized SVM, where we find
\begin{equation}
\label{svmregularized}
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \min} \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{w}|+C\sum_{\forall i} \max(1-c_i(\mathbf{w}^Tx_i+b), 0)^2
\end{equation}
where $C > 0$ is a penalty or regularization parameter that can be set to adjust for model bias or variance \cite{liblinear}. Here a penalty is only given if a document fails to meet the conditions in equation \ref{svmconstraint}, and when $C$ goes to infinity, the regularized SVM will solve the constrained problem.

For some types of data there might not be any plane that comes close to separate the two classes. For such problems, it is possible to use a nonlinear SVM. Such SVMs first map a document to a higher dimension where it is lineary separable by using a kernel function, and then apply a linear SVM \cite[p. 331]{information}. 

\section{Logistic Regression}

Logistic Regression (LR) is an other discriminative classifier where the confidence measure takes a probabilistic, and not geometric approach. With two classes, the probability of a given class can be written as
\begin{align}
p(C = 1| \mathbf{y}) &= \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|C = 1)p(C = 1)}{p(\mathbf{y}|C=1)p(C=1)+p(\mathbf{y}|C=-1)p(C=-1)} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\ln\frac{p(\mathbf{y}|C = 1)p(C=1)}{p(\mathbf{y}|C=-1)p(C=-1)})} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)} = \sigma(a) \label{logisticsigmoid}
\end{align}
where $\sigma(a)$ is called the \emph{logistic sigmoid} function \cite[p. 197]{machinelearningbook}, and $a$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{logistica}
a = \ln \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|C = 1)p(C=1)}{p(\mathbf{y}|C=-1)p(C=-1)}.
\end{equation}
The advantage of this seemingly inconvenient expression for $p(C=1 | \mathbf{y})$ is that $a$ can take any real value, and $\sigma(a)$ will transform $a$ to a value between $0$ and $1$. In section \ref{sect:svm} we argued that the distance from a separating hyperplane could be used as a measure of confidence in our classification.  With logistic regression, we can use this distance from a given hyperplane as a measure the log probability ratio \cite[p. 205]{machinelearningbook}
\begin{equation}
\label{logisticdist}
a = \ln \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|C=1)p(C=1)}{p(\mathbf{y}|C=-1)p(C=-1)} = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}+b.
\end{equation}
We can then find the hyperplane that maximize the probability of a set of documents belonging to their true class
\begin{align}
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \max} \prod_{\forall i} p(c_i | y_i)  &= 
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \max} \prod_{\forall i} \sigma(c_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b)) \nonumber \\
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \min} -\sum_{\forall i} \ln p(c_i | y_i) &= 
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \max} \sum_{\forall i} \ln \frac{1}{1+\exp(-c_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b))} \nonumber \\
&= \underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \min} \ln(1+\exp(-c_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b))). \label{simplelogistic}
\end{align}
Given that there exists a hyperplane that separates the classes, we can always find a hyperplane where $p(c_i | y_i) = 1$ for all the training documents by giving the normal vector, $\mathbf{w}$, an infinite length. As with the SVM we need an incentive to separate the classes with a plane that has a large euclidean distance to documents in each class. A more suited formulation is to penalize hyperplanes that makes a documents true class improbable using equation \ref{simplelogistic}, and maximize $1/|\mathbf{w}|$ so that the log probability ratio given in equation \ref{logisticdist} isn't oversensitive to small euclidean changes in the document vector $\mathbf{y}$. A formulation that should give models with less variance could then be \cite{liblinear}
\begin{equation}
\label{logisticreg}
\underset{\mathbf{w}, b}{\arg \min} \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{w}|+C\sum_{\forall_i} \ln(1+\exp(-c_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b)))
\end{equation}
where $C$ is a regularization parameter to avoid over-fitting. Other than using a different penalty-function, this optimization problem is then the same as the one from equation \ref{svmregularized} that was used to train SVMs. After we've found the hyperplane parameters from a training set, we can use $\sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{y}_i+b)$ as an estimate of the probability $p(C=1|\mathbf{y})$.
